## About Enigma

Enigma was a sophisticated cipher machine used by the Nazis during World War II to encrypt military communications. Renowned for its complex rotor mechanism, it generated seemingly unbreakable codes. However, the collaborative efforts and brainiacs like Alan Turing cracked the Enigma, giving the Allies a peek into the Nazis' plans and a big advantage in the war!

## Project Description

This project provides a tool for encrypting and decrypting text messages using an implementation inspired by the Enigma machine. Note: only text and spaces are supported.

## Features

- Encrypt text messages.
- Decrypt text messages.
- Simple and straightforward command-line interface.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Enigma project:

```sh
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install git
apt install python
git clone https://github.com/Abyss-17/enigma
cd enigma
python enigma
